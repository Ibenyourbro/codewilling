Error handling with Redux Toolkit. <br>
Basic Tailwind CSS. <br>

# Notes

Using Tailwind was fun, but a little challenging to get exactly how I wanted. I would say I spend majority of the time on this app working with Tailwind to get this very basic app. Once I understood how to use the classes however, it was fun to use.<br>

Using Redux Toolkit for the Api calls was also interesting. It was nice to move the calls out of my component. In contrast to something like Axios, where I am use to having my calls in the actual component.This way also allows me to use the same api call somewhere else, without having to rewrite it.
